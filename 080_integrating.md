# Integrating with existing JS libraries

There are two approaches:

- Expose your Go code to JavaScript

 For projects written primarily in JavaScript, perhaps to integrate with a specific Go library in a larger JavaScript app.

- Wrap JavaScript libraries in Go

 For projects written primarily in Go which need to communicate with an existing JavaScript library. For instance, to manipulate the DOM.
