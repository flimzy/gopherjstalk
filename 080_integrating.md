# Integrating with existing JS libraries

Two approaches:

- Expose your Go code to JavaScript

    To integrate a specific Go library into a larger JavaScript app.

- Wrap JavaScript libraries in Go

    For projects written primarily in Go which need to communicate with an existing JavaScript library. To manipulate the DOM, access Local Storage, Web Workers, etc.
