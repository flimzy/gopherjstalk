# A "short" demo

I wanted some presentation software that:

- Was simple to use
- Could understand Markdown and HTML
- Would allow running a GopherJS demo

So I wrote this presentation software in GopherJS to understand Markdown, thereby acheiving these goals.

I wrote only a single line of JavaScript when building this software:

``` javascript
$global.$ = require('jquery');
```

And that was only to demonstrate that using jQuery with GopherJS is trivial.
