This presentation software:

* Makes an AJAX request on startup, to read the index of slides
* As each slide is requested for display (on screen, or in the thumbnail view), it is:
 - Fetched via AJAX
 - Converted from Markdown to HTML (if appropriate)
 - Inline code is syntax highlighted in a Web Worker with the highlighter.js module
 - Cached for later use
* Navigation and paging is handled primarily by jQuery, with Go bindings
* All event handlers (key presses, clicks, resizing) are written in pure Go
