# Why not use GopherJS instead of JavaScript?

* All the standard reasons JavaScript is so cool (really??)
 - Dynamic types
 - **Callback hell!!!!!!!1**
 
But seriously:

* Steep learning curve
* You must be familiar with JavaScript internals, as well as Go
* There are still some bugs in GopherJS, but they are being quickly squashed
* Writing wrappers around JavaScript libraries can be time consuming
