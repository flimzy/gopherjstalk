# Why not use GopherJS instead of JavaScript?

* All the standard reasons JavaScript is so cool
 - Dynamic types
 - Strong DOM integration
 - **Callbacks!!!!!!!1**
 
But seriously:

* Steep learning curve

* Must be familiar with JavaScript internals, too

* Writing wrappers can be time consuming

* Compiled sizes are large (MBs)
