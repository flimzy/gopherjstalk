# Long-term future of gopherJS

1. After #2 above, there is talk of making JavaScript a build target for the official Go compiler, effectively integrating GopherJS into the official project.

# Other areas of personal interest

1. Polishing a framework to run unit tests in the browser
2. Support for 'runable examples' (blocked by a bug, which will be fixed as part of short-term item #2)
3. Best practices for browser bundling (browserify? Alternatives?)
