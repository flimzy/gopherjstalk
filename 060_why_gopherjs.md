# Why GopherJS instead of JavaScript?

* You can use Go libraries in the browser
* You can still use JavaScript libraries, too
* You can use the same language on the server and the browser
* All the standard reasons Go is so cool:
 - Strict types
 - Duct typing
 - Concise, unambiguous language
 - field tags in structs
 - html/template
 - interfaces
 - **Go routines!!!!!!!1**
