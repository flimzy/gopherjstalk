# Why GopherJS instead of JavaScript?

* Go libraries in the browser

* JavaScript libraries, too

* Same language on the server and the browser (Where have I heard this before?)

* All the standard reasons Go is so cool:
 - Strict types
 - Duck typing
 - field tags in structs
 - interfaces
 - **Go routines!!!!!!!1**
